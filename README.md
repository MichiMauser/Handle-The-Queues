# Handle-The-Queues
Project in Java for the Fundamental Programming Techniques Class

In this project I try to simulate using Threads Syncronization and Thread Pools some Queues in which the clients come and go.
I also made a graphical interface in java Swing that shows the simulation of the Queues under some circumstances.
